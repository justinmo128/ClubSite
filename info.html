                    <p class="game-info">
                        This game consists of multiple people (usually above 4 with the amount of people usually in the club) fighting until one person remains standing (there are three lives, or stocks). To do that, you have to knock them off the stage you are playing on by any means, and each attack on them increases their percentage which makes them easier to knock further, until they fall off. There's over 80 characters which leads to alot of replayability, and very fun.
